# The Mug of Sublime Text

Sublime Text is at its most sublime when you can remember the keyboard shortcuts. But there's an awful lot of them.  Thus, I created this keyboard shortcut reference which is weighted for web developement. I have included a select few customized keyboard commands; you can copy them by grabbing the appropriate .sublime-keymap file from this repo.
