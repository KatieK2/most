# The Mug of Sublime Text

Sublime Text is at its most sublime when you can remember its most useful and delightful keyboard shortcuts. Thus, I created this keyboard shortcut reference, which is focused on shortcuts that are part of ST's default installation. (A few keymap customizations are too awesome to be ignored; in those cases the keymap customizations are also included in the repo.)

This project doesn't include keyboard commands that are fairly standard to the operating system; such as `Ctrl Shift t` to re-open the most recently closed tab.
