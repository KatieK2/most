This is an online reference for the most useful delightful keyboard shortcuts for Sublime Text. I've tested each shortcut on Windows 7, and provided OSX alternatives when I found them. This reference focuses on shortcuts that are part of ST's default installation. A few keymap customizations are too awesome to be ignored; in those cases the customized keymap files are also included. 

This project **doesn't** include keyboard commands that are fairly standard to the operating system; such as `Ctrl Shift t` to re-open the most recently closed tab.

This project could really use alternative commands (when needed) for OSX and Unix. 

##Thank you!
